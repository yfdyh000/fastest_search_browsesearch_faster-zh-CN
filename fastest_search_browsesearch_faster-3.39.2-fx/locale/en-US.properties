ah_add_engine = Add a search engine to Fastest Search
ah_add_manually = Add manually?
ah_category = Category
ah_hint = hint
ah_msg_1 = Frankly, I haven't seen a search engine that cannot be added by using the 'Create Fastest Search' context menu option or 'Add Engine for Current Page' link in Options panel. But, if you insist, here's how to manually add an engine:%0A%0AGo to Google.com and right click inside query box and choose 'Create Fastest Search'. Change the name, URL (of the website), and query to 'http://mysite.com/whatever?q=DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS' (note that the 'DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS' will be changed to your search keyword when you do search with this engine). Test if 'GET' or 'POST' works for this engine. Add a Category and shortcut, and decide if you want it instant. You're done! %0A%0AFor correct favicon, you can use my Image2Icon Firefox addon's 'View site's Favicon' context menu option to get favicon URL, then edit the engine again and put this URL into the favicon url box.
ah_msg_10 = The higher the rank, the more likely this engine is used as default one in the same auto-detect engine category
ah_msg_11 = For single-engine search in FF urlbar/searchbar only: Loads search result page as you type.
ah_msg_2 = This is search engine's website URL. When you do not enter a keyword, Fastest Search will take you to this website address instead of running a query on the engine.
ah_msg_3 = This is the URL used when running a query on this search engine. You can change this URL to make surer it works as expected. Just remember to put a special word 'DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS' into the query URL exactly at where you would put the search keyword. This way 'Fastest Search' knows where to put the search keyword in.%0A%0ATo add a subdomain to Google search, use 'DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS_SUBDOM' for subdomain, 'DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS_DOM' for domain, 'DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS_TLD' for '.com' type of search.%0A%0AExample: An engine for the Google Subdomain search is included by default ('gsd' is its shortcut), and it uses 'http://www.google.com/search?q=DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS site:DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS_SUBDOM&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8' as the query string.
ah_msg_4 = Default is GET (query is coded in URL), but some engines might use POST (form submission, not through URL) to send query info. In such case, choose this method.%0A%0AIf unsure, just choose one and then use the test query below to see if it works for you. If it doesn't, choose the other one
ah_msg_5 = You could go to an icon site like iconfinder.com, search and find the icon you want. Right click and choose 'Copy image location', and then paste the copied URL here.
ah_msg_6 = This is the URL used for getting keyword suggestions while you type. %0A%0AIf nothing is entered here, Google's Suggest service will be used.%0A%0AIf you enter any non-valid URL like '.', or 'a' here, it's a hack that will disable Suggest for this engine.
ah_msg_7 = New in v1.53: Now you can have multiple categories for same engine (separate category names with ',' or ', ')!%0A%0AThis is the case-sensitive category that can be used in searching. Say, you added two engines to a category named 'MyCategory', then later in any search box you can type ';MyCategory keyword' to search the keyword on both engines. %0A%0ARemember, only '_', alphabet (a-z, A-Z), or numbers (0-9) are allowed in Category name. No space or other characters. Comma (',', ', ') can be used to separate multiple category names
ah_msg_8 = When you select a keyword on webpage, this program tries its best to guess which category you're likely searching, then it shows the icon and shortcut of the highest-ranked engine in the detected/guessed category. For example, if you selected 'GOOG', the program can guess you're trying to get stock quotes and it'll show you the highest-ranked engine in 'Finance' category, which is Google Finance by default. But if you selected 'Bach prelude', there's no telling you want to search Google or Youtube. Therefore Youtube, despite being in 'Video' category, is considered 'General' in auto-detect category because of this. %0A%0ARegardless of how you assign the category of this engine, only 5 auto-detect categories are currently supported: Dictionary, Finance, General, Maps, Translation. Any category you assigned that does not fall into these 5 categories, this program will internally use 'General' category when doing auto-detection%0A%0AYou can use the 'Text Recognition Rules' options panel to change how FS decides which engine is the best if you understand regular expression.
ah_msg_9 = Case-sensitive shortcut must be at most 4 characters long, and must only contain '_', alphabet (a-z, A-Z), or numbers (0-9), and must be unique for all engines!

fbh_maximum_number_of_matches = Maximum number of matches:
fbh_minimum_keyword_length_for_fayt = Minimum keyword length for FAYT:
fbh_msg_1 = Select this option to show a minimally sized Fastest Search Search Panel (the panel that shows up when you press 'Ctrl-Shift-F'.
fbh_msg_10 = Select this option to show a reminder of text search options when you search for text on web page.
fbh_msg_11 = Normally FAYT starts when you start typing, but it could be slow on very long pages. Set the value here to 2 means FAYT would not start unless you typed at least 2 characters. This would help performance. Starting in v2.10 which was packed with Addon SDK1.6, this defaults to 2 to alleviate (but not eliminate) a fairly annoying performance issue in Addon SDK1.5+. Unfortunately, older SDKs leak memory, so I had to use newer ones. Hope Addon SDK developers fix it soon.
fbh_msg_12 = If this is enabled, the Find-As-You-Type feature will not work on any domain names containing the string/regular expression typed below.
fbh_msg_2 = If this option is checked, then after you press the 'search' button to do text search in current tab, Fastest Search will present a summary panel listing all the matches on page. Each match comes with the number of context characters set by the value below.
fbh_msg_3 = Since v1.72 Match Distribution Bar (the bar that shows where matches are on page and match count) shows on the right side by default, because there it's less likely to block viewing anything. If you prefer the bar to be on the left side like before, uncheck this box.%0A%0ANote, making a change here will not update the location of existing Match Distribution Bars. You would have to clear the existing Match Distribution Bar by pressing 'Esc' key, then search again to show the Match Distribution Bar again. Now the new bar will on the side you want.
fbh_msg_4 = End searching for matches on page after this many matches have been found. For very long pages, highlighting and draw distribution of all matches could take a long time. Setting this number to lower (like 100) would make the display process much faster (most of the time is consumed by page text grabbing in this case).%0A%0ANote: Like a few other settings, this setting is overriden by pressing 'enter' key or the 'Search' button in Search Panel.
fbh_msg_5 = After text searching on page, when you mouseover a match on the Match Count & Distribution Bar, a popup shows the match in uppercase, along with some left context and right context. The length of context is determined by this value. If you choose to open a list of matches after pressing 'search' button, the context is also determined by this value.
fbh_msg_6 = After text searching on page, Match Count & Distribution Bar shows up. If this value is 0, it means the bar will stay there until you press 'Esc' key. If you set it to X (6 or higher), then the bar would auto-hide after X seconds. I'd say either 0 or at least 20 or higher would be good settings
fbh_msg_8 = This option speeds up FAYT by caching the text of the pages whose text takes longer than 0.5 seconds to gather. When cached text is used, the color of the count text - 'key (1 of 3)' changes to yellow background with gray font.%0A%0ANote: If you think (part of) the page changed, you should refresh the cache by pressing 'Ctrl-Shift-F' to open Search Panel, type in keyword, then press the 'Search' key to search. That will force refresh the cached text for the page. Then all FAYT will be fast and correct again.
fbh_msg_9 = When you use 'Ctrl-Shift-F' to open the Fastest Search's Search Box, you can start typing in the box, and Fastest Search will search on the page even if Find-As-You-Type above is NOT checked. Select this option to disable this behavior (this is only useful for pages that are very long and FAYT takes too much time).
fbh_no_fayt_when_typing_in_search_box = No FAYT when typing in Search Box
fbh_please_enter_one_string_or_regular_expression_pattern_per_line = Please enter one string (or regular expression) pattern per line

fbjs_context = Context characters takes a non-negative integer no greater than 70 only!
fbjs_bar = Match Distribution Bar auto-hide takes either 0 (no auto-hide) or a positive integer higher than 5 seconds (auto-hide in 5 seconds or less is just too fast)

The addon cannot determine the copyright for you and is NOT responsible for any copyright violations.
ih_msg_2 = Select this option to simply drag-n-drop to save image in one of 4 locations you can define based on the drop zone.
ih_msg_3 = Sometimes you want to save an image but it's a background image, some websites like flickr.com also blocks contextmenu even for the images for which copying is allowed (like some 'Some rights reserved' images that allow copying), select this option to save the blocked image or background image.
ih_msg_4 = Sometimes an image does not have a proper filename at all, like 'data:image' urls. Select this option to have the addon ask you for a name before saving the image, otherwise the image will be saved after given a unique name as 'unnamedxx.ext' (where 'ext' is the proper extension like jpg, png etc. and 'xx' is number that makes the name unique.)

it_msg_10 = Just type the phrase below into the textbox further below. After it's done, click on the 'Decide Values', that's it! To test again, press 'Clear Box Above' and try again.
it_msg_2 = Normally to search 'keyword' on Google or all Finance category engines in any box/bar, you need to use ';g keyword' or ';Finance keyword'. Select this option to allow using 'g keyword' and 'Finance keyword' to do the search in Firefox URLBar/SearchBar.%0A%0AWith this selected, you can also use 'g'(or other shortcut) + 'Enter' key to go to Google/other site instead of ';g' + 'Enter' key.
it_msg_3 = When you type a query in URLBar, Fastest Search automatically gets the search engine suggestions to predict what user wants to query, then use the top suggestion result as the search query for the Instant search. If, in fact, you would prefer to use only what you typed to do the Instant search, choose this option.
it_msg_4 = Google is used as the default search engine when you type a query in LocationBar, but you can type in the shortcut of your preferred engine here to set that engine as default. Remember, however, that a slow engine would render Instant feature not-so-instant. So pick a fast engine!
it_msg_5 = When typing a query in URLBar (LocationBar), Fastest Search will by default Instantly displays the best matching search result from your history/bookmark. If a good match is not found from history/bookmark, then the URL Bar Engine you set above (if not set, Google is used) will be searched using the query you typed in URLBar and the search result is Instantly displayed. Here you can choose to let Fastest Search to only do Instant display on history/bookmark result, URLBar engine result, or both
it_msg_6 = Instant in LocationBar is separate from Instant for engines, so for Instant for engines, choose a setting here. Your setting here will override the 'Use instant preview' setting for each individual engine unless you choose 'Per Engine Setting'.
it_msg_7 = When you type ';g my long query', the Instant feature will start load page while you're typing. Instead of loading one page, it might have attempted loading 3 pages with 'my l', 'my long qu' and 'my long query' as the query. The first 2 pages will NOT be saved in your browsing history. But the 3rd one will be added to your browsing history, after X second(s) - This X second of delay tells Fastest Search that you're likely done typing query and the final page should be added to history. The number set here becomes the 'X', and a range of 0.8-3 seconds are allowed.
it_msg_8 = For fast typers, Fastest Search delays loading pages until this minimum 'wait period' has passed. This is to prevent Google suspecting your computer as a bot and refuse to load search result pages. 0.15-1 is reasonable, depending on your typing speed
it_msg_9 = For fast typers, the minimum wait period above could delay loading page too much, so much so that no page is loaded until the person finished typing the entire query (because each new letter typed in will cancel the previous page load request). That makes Instant not Instant any more. So Fastest Search will fire a page loading request when this maximum 'wait time' is met. 0.4-2.5 is reasonable, depending on your typing speed

Once search result page fully displayed, click on Fastest Search icon then click this 'Add Engine for Current Page' link to add that engine.%0A%0ADon't forget to check if engine works using the Test querybox.

rh_explain = Explain the 2 rules above
rh_learn = Learn to use Regular Expression
rh_msg_1 = When you select text on a page, the regular expression you entered in the rules below will be evaluated one by one on the selected text. The first match found will be used to determine which engine gets shown in the popup for the selected text. If the first match is an engine shortcut, the engine will be shown in the shortcut. If the first match is category name, then the most frequently used engine in that category will be shown
rh_msg_2 = Format is: 'engine shortcuts/category names separated by ':',string length restriction,regular expression#:#comment/name of rule'.%0A%0AEngine shortcuts/category names could be 'gm','Finance','w:g'.%0ALength restriction:'>10','<=20'. It is optional, and if it's set, then the total length of the selected text must be meeting this length restriction.%0ARegular Expression:'/abc/i'. Please read more on Regular Expression if you're not familiar with it using the 'Learn to use regular expression' link.%0AThe rule name/comment (including the #:# preceding it) is optional. It's useful to remind yourself what the rule is for.
rh_msg_3 = The 1st rule sets Google Map as the default engine if the selected text length is no longer than 10 characters and is either all digits or digits followed by '-' then more digits (US zip code). Of course, a better regex for zip code is /^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$/ but I want to demo the length restriction here. The 2nd rule sets Wikipedia (higher priority because it's listed first) and IMDB to default if the selected text matches the usual name format

# Below is for the Smart Searchbox option panel
sb_delay_smart_searchbox_for = Delay Smart Searchbox for
sb_hide_smart_searchbox_after = Hide Smart Searchbox after
sb_msg_2 = If checked (default is checked), the Smart Searchbox that pops up after you select text on page would be as close as possible to your mouse click position but remain non-intrusive. Also, the Smart Searchbox will show up preferrentially on top of selection (unless it's too far from the mouse). Otherwise it tries to pop up at bottom of selection unless bottom is also too far.%0A%0ANote: When checked, this option also overrides the X,Y offsets below.%0A%0AIf unchecked, the Smart Searchbox will pop up right under your mouse (unless you set the X,Y offsets below to non-zero, or you have only 2 engines), which allows immediate click-n-go to get search results. I personally like this faster mode, but most users seem to prefer non-intrusive placement of the Smart Searchbox (which is also partly achievable using the X,Y offsets).
sb_msg_3 = When you select some text, this addon displays its Smart Searchbox right under your mouse (if you unchecked the 'Smart placement of Searchbox' option) except when you have only 2 engines. By setting X and/or Y here you can make the Smart Searchbox NOT pop up right under your mouse.%0A%0ARemember: Positive integer entered in X will make box go right, in Y will make box go down. Negative X makes box go left, negative Y makes box go up.%0A%0Ae.g., if you would like the Smart Searchbox to show above the selected text, set X:20 and Y:-35; set X:20 and Y:35 to pop under the selected text.
sb_msg_4 = When you select some text, this addon displays its Smart Searchbox right under your mouse (unless Smart placement and/or mouse offsets above are set, or you have only 2 engines). By default the Smart Searchbox pops up right away, but this could interfere with users needing triple clicks on a page (like users of my Double Click Closes Tab addon). Set a delay of 0.3 seconds here works very well for such triple click situations like my DCCT addon allows.%0A%0ANote: The vast majority of users would not need to change this option at all.
sb_msg_5 = When you select some text, this addon displays its Smart Searchbox right under your mouse (unless Smart placement or set mouse offsets above are set, or you have only 2 engines). To make this box less intrusive, select this option to dismiss it whenever you want. %0A%0ASet it to 0 to not display the Smart Searchbox at all (if you happen to need the Smart Searchbox again in such case, press 'shift' key AFTER selection will bring up the Smart Searchbox. Press 'ctrl' key to hide it again).
sb_seconds = seconds
sb_set_smart_searchbox_offset_x = Set Smart Searchbox offset X:
sb_smart_placement_of_the_smart_searchbox = Smart placement of the Smart Searchbox
sbjs_inval_num = Hide searchbox after X seconds option takes a valid non-negative number only!
sbjs_delay_inval_num = Delay showing the popup searchbox option takes a valid non-negative number only!
sbjs_int = Select popup offset takes only integers!

#####################################################################################
# Below is changed in v2.24
fh_msg_1 = Regular Expression is an advanced pattern matching syntax. Please Google 'Javascript Regular Expression' for acceptable syntax. Note that Match Case and Match Whole Word, if selected, are both applicable for RegEx match%0A%0ADo not use '/expression/i' format in keyword box, instead directly enter 'expression' to search for the regular expression 'expression'!
# changed in v3.0 or later
enter_match_number = Which match number do you want to go to? Please enter below:
invalid_match = The match number you entered is invalid!
sb_msg_1 = When you select text on page, the comma-separated engine/category shortcuts entered below will be popped up as icons, along with a textbox that you can enter any desired engine/category shortcut. This is Fastest Search's Smart Searchbox (SSB).%0A%0AANY number of engines/categories can be entered. The wildcard '*' indicates the engine should be determined by Fastest Search, wildcard '%23' indicates that FS should determine the best engine category for it.%0A%0AIf you enter nothing below, SSB won't show up when you select text (not even if you press 'Shift' key).%0A%0AI recommend you use '*' or your favoratie engine for the first engine. BTW, Fastest Search decides the engines for the wildcards by the rules in the 'Text Recognition Rules' panel.%0A%0ANote: The icon displayed for categories will be the icon for the top engine in that category, with a dotted red border to tell you it's a category icon, not an engine icon (but if the engine category is determined by FS, then border is blue dotted).
sb_msg_6 = This number defines the width and height of the engine/category icons in the Smart Searchbox that pops up after you select text
sb_set_smart_searchbox_size = Set Smart Searchbox width/height:
sb_msg_7 = The keyword/keyphrase you enter here will be used to generate the SSB (Smart Searchbox) preview.  The preview below will look the same as the SSB that pops up if you selected the same keyword/phrase on an actual webpage.
sb_ssb_previewkey = Preview SSB with:
sb_smart_searchbox_engines = SSB engines/categories
sbjs_inval_sc = is an invalid engine shortcut for popup engines/categories. Please fix it by replacing it to wildcard "*" or remove it.
sh_shortcut_to_set_tag_for_find = Shortcut for HTML tag search: Ctrl-Alt-
sh_shortcut_to_regex = Shortcut to toggle regex search: Ctrl-Alt-
sh_shortcut_to_whole = Shortcut to toggle whole-word search: Ctrl-Alt-
sh_shortcut_to_case = Shortcut to toggle case-senitivity: Ctrl-Alt-
sh_shortcut_to_listener = Shortcut to refresh FS listeners: Ctrl-Alt-
sh_shortcut_to_f3 = Shortcut to toggle F3/F2 start position: Ctrl-Alt-
sh_msg_3 = Regular expression text search toggle. Enter a single letter (A-Z) here.%0A%0ANote: If you enter nothing, it means do not use shortcut for this toggle.
sh_msg_6 = Enter a single letter (A-Z) here.%0A%0ANote: If you enter nothing, it means do not use shortcut for this toggle. Details: Pressing this key combination will open a prompt where you can limit text search to only the text inside the HTML tags you enter.
sh_msg_7 = Whole word text search toggle. Enter a single letter (A-Z) here.%0A%0ANote: If you enter nothing, it means do not use shortcut for this toggle.
sh_msg_8 = Case-sensitive/insensitive text search toggle. Enter a single letter (A-Z) here.%0A%0ANote: If you enter nothing, it means do not use shortcut for this toggle.
sh_msg_9 = For some users Fastest Search randomly stops working (due to either incompatibilities due to Firefox/Addon SDK/other addons). Press this key combination to manually refresh the state and get it working again. Enter a single letter (A-Z) here.%0A%0ANote: If you enter nothing, it means do not use shortcut for this toggle.
sh_msg_10 = Use this shortcut to flip between the default and special mode of how F3/F2 searches for the next/previous match. By default, F3/F2 would search for next/previous match starting from the current match; In the special mode, F3/F2 would search for the next/previous match starting from the current page position instead, which allows you to skip many matches and restart matching from where you pick on the page. Note that the special mode is not bug free yet (I noticed that it does not work well on gmail), so if it is NOT correctly looping through all matches on a page, use this shortcut to turn it off again.
restricted = restricted
regexmode = Regular expression mode is
wholemode = Whole word search mode is
casemode = Search is now
caseinsensitive = case insensitive
casesensitive = case sensitive
refreshed = Listeners refreshed!
oh_autorefresh = Auto-prevent Fastest Search from stopping
oh_msg_8 = For some users Fastest Search randomly stops working (due to either incompatibilities due to Firefox/Addon SDK/other addons). If this checkbox is checked, Fastest Search will try to regularly auto-refresh part of itself (technically, the event listeners) to prevent such issues.%0A%0ANote that if you do not want auto-refresh, uncheck this. You can still press Ctrl-Alt-L to manually refresh when needed (you can change this shortcut in the 'Keyboard Shortcuts' option above).
oh_msg_7 = For some users Fastest Search randomly stops working (due to either incompatibilities due to Firefox/Addon SDK/other addons). Therefore the 'Auto-refresh to prevent stopping' above is checked by default to have FS auto-refresh itself (thus keeping itself going despite unknown incompatibilities). But if the disabling issue happen rather infrequently, you can uncheck the option about and instead press Ctrl-Alt-L to manually refresh FS when needed. %0A%0AJust in case, I don't think this would happen but if such remedy still fails for you, then go to Addon Manager and disable then reenable Fastest Search. In worst case, reinstall Fastest Search and/or restart Firefox. I haven't seen such a need since newer Firefox and new Addon SDK came out last year though.
preview_only_in_real_page = SSB Preview requires that the current tab contains a real web page
fbh_f3_start_here = F3/F2 starts from current page position (a little buggy)
fbh_msg_13 = By default, F3/F2 would search for next/previous match starting from the current match; If you check this checkbox (you can also use shortcut Ctrl-Alt-N or whatever you changed it to in Keyboard Shortcuts settings), F3/F2 would search for the next/previous match starting from the current page position instead. This allows you to skip many matches and restart matching from where you pick on the page. This feature is not bug free right now (I noticed that it does not work well on gmail), so if it is NOT correctly looping through all matches on a page, uncheck this checkbox (or use shortcut Ctrl-Alt-N or whatever you changed it to in Keyboard Shortcuts settings).
f3_starts_current_position = Now F3/F2 would search for the next/previous match starting from the current page position (still a bit buggy - turn it off if it doesn't work on a page)
f3_starts_prev_match = F3/F2 would search for next/previous match starting from the current match (default behavior).
fbh_ignore_diacritics = Ignore diacritic when not searching with regex
fbh_msg_14 = When enabled, non-regular-expression text search will ignore diacritics when searching ('??t' becomes a match when you type 'at' to search). For now, this option is NOT available when you do regular expression search - it's a little complicated to do that because this feature is itself implemented with regex and could conflict if not done carefully. Might do that in the future.
oh_reshowopts = Re-show this panel after closing a settings panel
oh_msg_9 = After you're done saving/canceling a settings panel like 'keyboard shortcuts', would you prefer to have the main Options panel shown again or not?%0A%0AIf you're a new user, frequently you'd like to have the Options panel shown again so you can work on other settings panels. In that case, keep this option checked.%0A%0ABut if you've worked with Fastest Search for a while and usually only work with one settings panel at a time, uncheck this might be better for you.
fbh_max_matches_per_tab = Max displayed per tab:
fbh_msg_15 = This setting applies only to searching in multiple/all tabs. Only this number of matches will appear in the result list after the tab search.
fbjs_numdiff = Maximum number displayed per tab cannot be bigger than the maximum match number (for current tab)!
fh_msg_2 = Search the text content of tabs if this is selected (a popup will ask if you would like to restrict to certain tabs or search all tabs for your keyword).%0A%0ANote: The visualization and results shown as you type when 'In Tabs' is checked is for current tab only! You have to press the 'Enter' key or click the 'Search' button to search in all tabs.%0A%0ASince v3.12, you have to hold Alt key while pressing the 'Enter' key or clicking the 'Search' button to restrict which tab(s) you want to search on.%0A%0ASince v3.22, you can hold Ctrl key to reverse the 'In Tabs' setting!
loadmsg = PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!!%0A%0AYou have %s tabs that are not loaded yet (maybe you restarted Firefox). Do you want to load their contents now?%0A%0AIf you choose CANCEL, no tab-loading will be done and search will be done on only the tabs that are already loaded.%0A%0AIf you choose OK, search will be cancelled as the tabs will be loaded and loaded large number of tabs at once could be slow. You should do search once tabs are fully loaded.
oh_shop = Enable shopping assistant
oh_shop1 = Shopping assistant disabled for now
oh_msg_10 = 'Fastest Shopping Assistant' leverages the Superfish technology to find the best pricing on products identical or very similar to the one you are looking at, using an index of over 300 million product offers from tens of thousands of merchants. The recommended product(s), once found, will show up under the product image on the web page.%0A%0AAs such it can be very helpful for online shopping. Please give it a try - if you don't find it helpful, two clicks disables it: Click the Fastest Search icon on the Firefox Addon Bar then uncheck the feature. More info including real life example can be found on the webpage shown right after your installed Fastest Search.
oh_msg_11 = Privacy Policy
oh_msg_12 = A new online shopping feature that makes product comparison a no-brainer
oh_msg_13 = Best price for identical/similar products shows up under the product image you're looking at
oh_msg_14 = 300+ million products from 50000+ merchants are compared to find the best price
oh_msg_15 = Utilizes the Superfish's Similar Products visual search engine
oh_msg_privacy_fs = Fastest Search itself does not collect/store/transmit any user information whatsoever.
oh_msg_privacy_engine = The various search engines like Google, Bing, Superfish etc. may have their own privacy policies
oh_msg_privacy_sf = Privacy policy of Superfish search engine will be loaded below (Firefox 26 has a <b>bug on Windows</b> so if the document display below does not look right after <b>scrolling</b>, <u>just wait a few seconds</u>)
mis_msg_6 = Select this option to copy the URL of the current page to clipboard when you press ctrl-c on a page without selecting anything first. But if you press ctrl-c in a textbox without selecting text in the box, the entire text box content will be copied to clipboard. %0A%0ANote that since v3.20 this feature includes Smart Cut, which means ctrl-x would cut entire text of an inputbox if you didn't select any text inside the inputbox.
mis_msg_8 = When this option is selected, if you paste with ctrl-p or middle button click (if you enabled it) while the mouse focus is NOT inside a place you can input text, the text on clipboard will be pasted to URL bar and go if text is a valid URL, otherwise it is pasted into the first textbox on page if available, otherwise into the searchbar.%0A%0ANote that if you enable both middle click pastes and this option, and your middle click accidentally misses a link, the smart paste will kick in and paste clipboard like mentioned above. If that happens to you, just disable one of the two options to get rid of this behavior.
mis_smart_copy = Smart Cut/Copy
mis_smart_paste = Smart Paste
ph_msg_2 = If you select this option, then when you type ';g keyword' in a textbox or searchbar and press 'return' key, the Preview Panel instead of a new tab is opened (this is the reverse of the default behavior).%0A%0ANote that since v3.22, holding down Shift key will reverse this option, meaning that type 'g test' then Shift-Enter keys would open search result in preview panel if 'text search to preview' setting is 'none', and open in tab if the setting is set otherwise.
enableSF = Enable the 'Fastest Shopping Assistant' (recommended)?
enablesf_msg_open = More Information
enablesf_msg_close = Less Information
button_yes = Yes
button_no = No
mis_tableft = Open SSB/search result tabs on left
mis_msg_9 = When new tab opens when you click on SSB icon or press Enter key (or in some other search situations), tab could open either on the left of current tab or the right, depending on this option. Left is default since v3.31 (right was default before).
mis_speeddial = Speed Dial addon interfering
mis_msg_10 = Only check this if you installed Speed Dial addon and found that if you open new Firefox window, the URL bar of the new window never updates. One user found this issue before. Checking this option delays FS from working in URL bar for 2 seconds (which delays Instant search in URL bar), which gets around this conflict. However, in FF 27.0.1 I could no longer reproduce this conflict.%0A%0AI suspect this option is no longer needed as I can't reproduce this conflict any more. But I'm leaving it here just in case.
fbh_msg_7 = Select this option to let Fastest Search search text on page as you start typing on page (this will override Firefox's own Find-As-You-Type). You can also use Ctrl-Alt-F shortcut to turn on/off Find-As-You-Type quickly.%0A%0ANote: Since v3.32, this option is overriden by the option below, which when checked allows a slash '/' to activate FAYT even if this option is unchecked.
fbh_msg_slash = Select this option to allow typing a slash ('/') to activate FAYT, even if the use FAYT option above is unchecked. This mimics Firefox's own behavior on FAYT.
fbh_slash_fayt = Allow '/' to activate Find-as-you-type
enter_tag = Restrict text search using modified XPath (e.g., enter 'a' (without quotes!) to search text for only links; 'a | li' (again all restrictions should be without quotes!!) to search both links and lists - to separate top level elements you must use '|' instead of 'or'!!).%0A%0AMore examples: 'table//li | a' searches only li under table tag plus all links%0A'a[contains(@href, 'yahoo')]' then if you type keyword "news", it'd find all links pointing to yahoo that have "news" in link text; keyword '.+' in regex mode finds all links pointing to yahoo.%0A'li[@test]' searches li with an attribute 'test'%0A'li[contains(@class, 'abc') and @test]' searches li with an attribute 'test' and class='abc'%0A'li[contains(concat(' ',@class,' '), ' abc ') and not(contains(concat(' ',@class,' '),' what '))]' finds li with class 'abc' but not 'what'.%0A%0AAlso note: By default, text input and textarea are searched, but if you enter any value here, they are no longer searched! You MUST clear this value if you no longer want to restrict the text search to certain HTML elements.
fbh_pipe_is_or = Use '|' as logical OR in non-regex text search
fbh_msg_pipeor = In regex, '|' means logical OR, so 'old|new' (when regex enabled) will find you all 'old' and 'new' words in text. But users who need ignore-diacritics cannot use regex in the search. To allow these users still search multiple terms at once, check this checkbox and use '|' as logical OR. This works even if you did not enable regex search (or you checked 'ignore diacritics' above).
fjs_prompt_exp = Advanced feature - Post processing matches. It allows you to do cool things like finding all numbers that are >= 35 and < 65.7, or finding all employees in a salary table who is younger than 30, start date later than 2013/01/01 but earns more than $200,000 (warning: good knowledge of RegEx and JavaScript needed). Now here is howto:%0A%0AFor first task, assuming that you already enabled regex and entered an expression of "[0-9.]+", then just enter "return _MATCHES[0] >= 35 && _MATCHES[0] < 65.7" below will do it! _MATCHES is simply what the RegExp.exec(string) returns, so _MATCHES[0] contains the entire match of your regex ([0-9.]+ in this case), _MATCHES[1] is substring match in the 1st paranthesis in the regex (none in this case), and so on. For example, If you have a regex of "(w+): (d+)", and you try on a page that contains "ab cde: 123", then _MATCHES[0] will be "cde: 123", _MATCHES[1] will be "cde" and _MATCHES[2] will be "123" (not 123! so if you need arithmetic operation, do not forget to -0 first).%0A%0AIn 2nd case, assuming you used expression "(d{2}) (d{4}/d{1,2}/d{1,2}) $([0-9,]+)" to find age startdate salary combination in an HTML table (http://www.datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/row_grouping.html - it\\'s not my TableTools2 BTW!), then just enter "return _MATCHES[1] < 30 && Date.parse(_MATCHES[2]) > Date.parse(\\'2013/01/01\\') && _MATCHES[3].replace(/,/g, \\'\\') > 200000" will do it.%0A%0AImportant: 1. Remember the last statement needs to return a boolean indicating if match is found. 2. When searching across HTML block elements like <TD>, <DIV>, add a space (that is why the regex above had space in it). 3. If you code gets complex, it is easier if you try it on jsFiddle or a real script first and paste it here only when it is correct.
